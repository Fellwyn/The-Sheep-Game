# The Sheep game üêë 
**[comment 10/2025:<br>
This project was created during early phase of my JS journey and nowadays I use different approach to structures, styling and overall JS functionality]** <br><br>

I created this very simple game to practice using the Kaboom.js library. <br>
In this project, I learned how to:
- Make a player character collect items
- Remove objects from the scene after they're collected
- Add several images based on players movement direction
- Use collision detection to trigger actions <br>
I used YouTube, the Kaboom.js documentation, various websites, and examples from other developers to help build the game.



#### Things to fix/add:

- blocks to prevent the player from moving outside the playable area
