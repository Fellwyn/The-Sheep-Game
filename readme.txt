Sheep game

I wanted to practise more kaboom.js library so
I created this very simple game. I learned to make the 
player to collect items and to make those
objects disappear from the platform.

I used Youtube, Kaboom.js library, several websites
and other developers' examples to create this game.



Things to fix/add:

-There is a white wall for test purposes. I am trying to add 
invisible blocks around the game area and every object, but
currently it is not working.
-Next level


Here is the link to the game:
