Sheep game

I wanted to practise more kaboom.js library so
I created this very simple game. I learned to make the 
player to collect items and to make the
objects disappear from the platform.

I used Youtube, Kaboom.js library, several websites
and other developers' examples to create this game.



Things to fix/add:

-would not be able to cross obstacles, landscape and playing area edges
-next level
